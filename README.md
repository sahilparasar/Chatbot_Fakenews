# NLP Assignment 4: Chatbots & NLP Applications



## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the laboratory assignment for **Unit 4: Chatbots, Fake News, and Social Media Analytics**. The project demonstrates how to build practical NLP applications using supervised learning techniques.

The solution is divided into two main modules:
1.  **Intent-Based Chatbot:** A system that classifies user queries into intents (Greeting, Query, Feedback) and handles unknown inputs with fallback logic.
2.  **Fake News Detector:** A binary classifier that distinguishes between Real and Fake news headlines based on linguistic patterns.
